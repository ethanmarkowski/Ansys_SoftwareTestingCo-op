# Ansys_SoftwareTestingCo-op
This repository contains a small sample of the programming related work that I completed during my time as a Software Testing Co-op at Ansys, Inc. As Ansys, I worked on the Discovery simulation product with both the Application Testing and the Customization teams. For more details of my work there, see my portfolio page here: (https://ethan-markowski.weebly.com/ansys-inc---software-testing-co-op.html)

The "UI Regression - Tests" folder contains samples of tests I created using SCJournals, which are logs of UI commands. These consist of mouse and keyboard inputs and the user interface commands that are triggered from these interactions. These tests are set up within an in-house Testing Framework written in C#. The Testing Framework could not be shown here, but supports and facilitates the construction of regression tests based around these SCJournals.

The "Python API - Regression Tests" folder contains samples of tests that I programmed to cover Discovery's Python scripting API. Like the UI tests, these are also set up within the Testing Framework.

Finally, the "Misc Python Tools" folder contains miscellaneous scripts that I programmed to complete helpful tasks, such as checking for overlap in the names of regression tests and creating Visual Studio playlists to be run in Test Explorer. The PerformanceTool contains code I worked on related to an automated performance triage tool that we tied in with the daily regression test runs.
